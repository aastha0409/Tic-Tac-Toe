# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on a grid, either on a single machine or potentially in a future version, over a network.

**Features**
Two-Player Mode: Players can take turns making moves on the game board.
Game Board: A 3x3 grid where players can place their X or O marks.
Win Detection: The game automatically detects winning conditions or a draw.
User Interface: A simple command-line interface that displays the game board and prompts players for input.

**Technologies Used**
Java: The core programming language used to build the game logic and functionality.

**How It Works**
Game Setup: The game initializes a 3x3 board and prompts players to take turns.
Player Moves: Players enter their move by specifying the row and column where they want to place their mark.
Win/Draw Conditions: The game checks after each move if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
Game End: The game announces the result (win or draw) and can be restarted.

**Future Enhancements**
GUI: Implementing a graphical user interface using Java Swing or JavaFX for a more interactive experience.
AI Opponent: Adding an AI opponent with different difficulty levels.
Network Play: Enabling network play for multiplayer games over the internet.
Save and Load: Implementing functionality to save and load game states.
